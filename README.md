## 💡 Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT**

   - Designed and developed a Full-stack web application named "Budget Buddy", that enables users to
   track and manage their personal finances including income, expenses, and savings goals using modern
   web technologies.

   - Implemented the Front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and
   Responsive user interface. Leveraged React.js for building interactive components that allows users
   to easily interact with their budget data.

   - Built the Back-end with Node.js and Express.js ensuring robust and scalable server-side logic for Data
   handling, User authentication, performing financial calculations and API integration.

2. **EDA ANALYSIS ON ONLINE PAYMENT FRAUD DETECTION**
   
   - Conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of online payment transactions
   using Python and Jupyter Notebook, employing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to
   analyze and visualize transaction data for patterns indicative of fraudulent activities.

   - Applied statistical techniques and various data visualization techniques like Line plots, Count plot,
   Histograms, Scatter plots, Box plots, Violin plots, Strip plots, Pair plots, Heat map to identify key
   trends and anomalies in the dataset, used Seaborn and Plotly to create interactive and informative
   visualizations.

 3. **FOOD QUALITY TESTING SYSTEM USING IoT**  

    - Developed an IoT-based food quality testing device that continuously monitors key parameters such as pH levels, temperature, and humidity, ensuring food safety and freshness.
    
    - Created a user-friendly web interface for real-time data visualization and implemented automated alerts via SMS or email when quality indicators exceed acceptable limits.
   
    - Utilized technologies including Arduino/Raspberry Pi, cloud services, and data visualization libraries, achieving a 90% accuracy rate in detecting spoilage and demonstrating my skills in IoT and commitment to food safety.
